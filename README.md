# Rocket-recycling with Reinforcement Learning based recycling game

Developed by: [Leo Liu](https://github.com/githubLeoliu)


## About this project

This project is based on a rocket recycling with reinforcement learning developed by  Zhengxia Zou, Ph.D.

I was inspired by his AI approach of recycling rocket. By modifying his project, users can try recycling the rocket as it is a game. 

Feel free to try if you think you can beat the artificial intelligent algorithm.

For the landing task, I followed the basic parameters of the Starship SN10 belly flop maneuver. The initial speed is set to -50m/s. The rocket orientation is set to 90 degrees (horizontally). The landing burn height is set to 500 meters above the ground.
